## Simulation
This is a simulation of a tower defense game.
Because it is a continuos simulation, the game will not end when there are no more enemies left or when the player loses all hit points.
Instead, it will count multiple stats over a period of time and at the end it will display the statistics, like how many enemies have been defeated, how many of them managed to go past your defenses, how many of your knights were defeated by enemies, how much dmg has been dealt in total by the enemies and the defense, etc.

The parameters that allow the simulation to run differently each time are: game difficuty/enemy level, number of enemies, number of towers etc.
